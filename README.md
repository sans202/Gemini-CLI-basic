# Gemini-CLI-basic
A very basic Gemini CLI made in python. It's in the early stage, every feedback is appreciated! (Nah don't use this, there are better tools out there!)

This uses gemini-1.0-pro

# Features
-Temperature: You can modify the temperature (creativity) of the AI in between 0 and 1. Not inputting anything will just make it 0.5.

-Role: You can add a role. If you do, it'll make a custom prompt to send. This SHOULD give you a more accurate result

-Multi-language: You can change the language of the CLI! For now only Italian and English work

# Limits
The API is FREE (I provide it), so you all can only do 60 requests per minute. If you want your own AI, check out Google AI studio at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey (availability may vary) and change the API key in the code

# Things to make
-Context window: For now the AI just starts a new conversation every message. I plan to give it context instead until you restart the project (High priority) (Planned 0%)

-Clean up code: The code is messy (Low priority) (Planned 0%)
